# /etc/motd is dynamically generated by pam on login. The intention of this check is to ensure that OS
# information is not disclosed, therefore the more appropriate option is to ensure that the scripts which
# generate motd, and which are related to system information which would otherwise be
# displayed by mingetty options, are not present.
# On amazon linux, this is the 30-banner script within /etc/update-motd.d/
